This assignment consists of two parts: a customer interaction and a manager interaction.
The customer can select an item to purchase and, if sufficient quantity is on-hand, the stock quantity will be decremented and the total cost of the order shown to the customer.  If there is insufficient stock the customer will receive a message.

The manager interaction allows viewing of the full inventory, viewing a list of items with low stock (< 5), changing the quantity of items in inventory, and adding a new product item to stock.
